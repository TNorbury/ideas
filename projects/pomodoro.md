Thinking of using this as a way to try out Flutter for desktop. Basically just like very other pomodoro app, but by me :)

One thing I want to be sure to add is an "implicit snooze", meaning that when any of the timers goes off, the user will need to open the app and switch to the next mode, otherwise the alarm will keep going off every 30 secs or so.
