Budgeting software, everyone's favorite topic ;).

But really, I just want an easy to use budgeting program that does everything I want it to

## Features I want
* import transaction data from bank in either csv or ofx (needed for credit card transactions...)
* apply categories to a transaction (emphasis on plural!!)
* Create custom ITTT filters (if transaction name container string ... then apply ... label
* Allow transactions to be split (I'm imagining that when a transaction is split it'll still remain "whole" and then have some sub-transactions that define the split)
* spending limits based upon categories
* graphs to show spending over a certain amount of time
* support for investments (this could be basic, just manually entering data points)
